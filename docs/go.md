# Go modules support in forest

When it comes to fetching go modules from IPFS, we can use the integrity hashes provided by sum.golang.org as a content address, but rather than the hashes providing a content address directly to an archive of source code (a zip in go's case), we get a metafile which contains a list of hashes for ever file contained in the archive. Let's look at an example:

If we load the integrity hashes for [github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-blankhost](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-blankhost), at version [0.2.0](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-blankhost/releases/tag/v0.2.0) from [sum.golang.org](https://sum.golang.org/lookup/github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-blankhost@v0.2.0) we get the following:

```

```

Focusing on the hash of the whole module (line 2), we see a base64 encoded sha2-256 of a "metafile" (`h1:3EsGAi0CBGcZ33GwRuXEYJLLPoVWyXJ1bcJzAJjINkk=`), which looks something like this:

```

This metafile is a list of files (excluding folders) that the module contains with the sha2-256 of the contents of each file, separated by 2 spaces.

The reason that the go modules designers decided to do this rather than just hashing the zip file is that it allows them to change the compression of the zip without affecting existing integrity hashes stored in sum.golang.org.

If we assume that the almost all the individual files will be smaller than 1mb (max ipfs block size), then we can use the hashes in the metafile to be able to load each file directly from IPFS without needing to know it's CID up front.

Similarly, when a go module if first added to IPFS by forest it needs to take a different approach than just `ipfs add module.zip`, instead we download the zip file from [proxy.golang.org](https://proxy.golang.org/github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-blankhost/@v/v0.2.0.zip), extract the files and hash each one of them with sha2-256, then combine them together to create a metafile of that module, which we add to ipfs. We then also add each individual file to IPFS as well.

The zip file can then be reconstructed by other users over IPFS purely from the integrity hash of the metafile from sum.golang.org.

The are also a couple of gotchas when reconstructing the zip files to ensure they are the same every time:

- any file dates need to be set to `Nov 30 00:00:00 1979`
- files need to be added in alphabetical order
- no unix permissions must be set on the files (set them to `0`)
- don't create folders, just add the files at the correct paths
- set the compression to `DEFLATE` at level `8`
